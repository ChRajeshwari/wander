    <p class="con-p2">The wide open space that Montana is famed for is also the reason the cost of a trip can quickly add up – getting around this beautiful state to see and experience everything can burn up your bank account.
<br><br>
        But there are ways to stretch your dollars and visit Montana on a budget. The incredible landscape is mostly free to enjoy, and outdoor activities are the name of the game. From major free events during the summer season, opting for self-catering to save on both accommodations and eating out, and getting creative with transport options, there are lots of ways to save money on a trip to the Treasure State. </p>

   <h1 class="con-h3">1. The cheapest airport is probably the one closest to your destination</h1>
   <p class="con-p2">India is immense, taking at least 11 hours to drive across the state. And because it's not a common connection for other flights, it's not always cheap or easy to fly there. But if you find affordable flights, they're probably landing at Bozeman Yellowstone International, the state's busiest airport, or the expanding Missoula Montana Airport.
<br><br>
    But if you want to explore other parts of the state, any money you saved by flying into Bozeman or Missoula could be negated by travel costs. If heading to Glacier, try looking for flights to Glacier International Airport in Kalispell. And for those wanting to check out places like Fort Peck Lake or Makoshika State Park in eastern Montana, Billings Logan International Airport is a better starting point.</p>
<h1 class="con-h3">2. Attend free events throughout the summer</h1>

    <p class="con-p2">Every season adds to the beautiful landscape in Montana, but the summer makes everything shine. And Montana's cities and towns know how to celebrate the nice weather with family-friendly and free events almost every day of the week.

    Hang around Caras Park on the Clark Fork River in Missoula, and you might catch live music on Wednesday afternoons or Thursday evenings as part of the Out to Lunch or Downtown ToNight series. This beautiful community space is also home to the Saturday Farmers' Market and ground central for First Friday celebrations every month. </p>

    <h1 class="con-h3">3. Go for a Hike</h1>
    <p class="con-p2">You'll notice that most people you meet in Montana always look ready to go on a hike, and that's probably because they are. There are hiking trailheads around every corner, and there's a community emphasis on protecting the wild lands they traverse. Whether a slow ramble next to the river or an all-day excursion to a mountaintop, hiking is a way of life in Montana for several reasons, including its ease of access and affordability. 
<br><br>
    An entire summer season would be well spent hiking the public lands surrounding Bozeman free of charge, courtesy of Custer Gallatin National Forest. The College M Hiking Trail is an excellent place to start, seen prominently throughout town and part of the Main Street to the Mountains network. And less than 60 miles south, Beehive Basin, beneath the looming Lone Peak, belongs on everyone's hiking bucket list.</p>

    <h1 class="con-h3">4. Camp the night away</h1>
    <p class="con-p2">One of the best ways to save money on a Montana vacation is by camping under the stars. Designated campgrounds punctuate the national forests, national parks and state parks throughout Montana, featuring campsites for tents and RVs, always at a fraction of a hotel room cost. Just be sure to book months ahead for popular sites, such as anywhere in Glacier National Park. 
       <br><br> Free primitive camping is also available throughout the vast acreage of Montana's national forests. Primitive sites typically comprise a pull-out from a Forest Service road with zero amenities like running water or restrooms. Aim to camp at an already established pull-out, i.e., where someone else has camped before, and follow all tenets of Leave No Trace while free camping in Montana's national forests
