    <p class="con3-p1">You've dreamed of finally taking a break from your day-to-day life to travel abroad and experience different countries and cultures. Now you're finally doing it. <br><br>

        However, despite all the excitement and possibilities of a new adventure, you can't ignore the potential risks that could disrupt your vacation. <br><br>
        
        The good news is there are many ways to prepare for potential hiccups during your trip. Research your destination before visiting and educate yourself on ways to stay safe. This could decrease your chances of facing an unsafe situation in an unfamiliar country. <br><br>
        
        Follow these guidelines to help you stay safe while traveling. Don't forget to trust your instincts and allow yourself to enjoy the new experience while traveling internationally too</p>
     <h1 class="con3-h1"><span class="sp0">SAFETY TIPS</span> Before You Depart on Your Trip </h1>
   <p class="con3-p1">Education and preparation can help you be a smarter traveler and stay safe while abroad. </p>
   <h1 class="con3-h2">1. Research Common Travel Scams in Your Destination </h1>
   <p class="con3-p1">Travelers can quickly fall victim to scams, especially in new and unfamiliar destinations. The best way to prepare is to do a quick Google search of common scams in your travel destination. <br><br>

    Locals and experienced travelers can provide helpful advice, like certain taxis to avoid or other situations to steer clear of. </p>
   <h1 class="con3-h2">2. Make Sure You Have All the Necessary Vaccinations </h1>
   <p class="con3-p1">The CDC recommends that travelers get necessary vaccinations at least a month before traveling. Visit the CDC Travelers' Health page for your travel destinations to find out what vaccinations to get. 
<br><br>
    Some vaccinations may take time for your doctor to obtain, so schedule your visit with plenty of time before you plan to leave. </p>

    <h1 class="con3-h2 text">3. Check for Dangerous Weather Conditions in your Destination </h1>
    <p class="con3-p1">Before traveling, check the weather for your travel destination. Consider changing plans if conditions could be unsafe for planned activities, especially outdoor activities. <br><br>

        Extreme weather conditions like snowstorms and hurricanes could make it unsafe to travel to your destination at all. Keep an eye on weather conditions leading up to your trip, and avoid travel during seasons when extreme or dangerous weather is frequent in the area. </p>
     <h1 class="con3-h2">4. Make Copies of Important Documents</h1>
     <p class="con3-p1">When preparing for your trip, make copies of any important documents you are taking with you. If these documents are lost or stolen, copies can help in their recovery or in getting new ones. <br><br>

        Copy your ID, passport, visa, travel insurance documentation, and other necessary information and keep them with you. </p>
     <h1 class="con3-h2">5. Learn Common Phrases for Asking for Help in the Local Language </h1>
  <p class="con3-p1">If you don't speak the local language, learn a few important phrases that can help in the event of an emergency. It is very possible to find yourself in an emergency with people who don't speak the same language as you. </p>
 <p class="con3-p1">Some helpful phrases include: </p>
 <ul class="rul1">
    <li>"Help!"</li>
    <li>"I need a doctor"</li>
    <li>"Call the police."</li>
    <li>"It's an emergency."</li>
 </ul>

 <h1 class="con3-h2">6. Keep Regular Contact with Family and Friends </h1>
<p class="con3-p1">Let trusted friends and family know where you are traveling and how long. Keep regular contact with these people to ensure your safety throughout your trip. 

    You might consider leaving your itinerary plans with a trusted person at home in case an emergency does arise. </p>
    <h1 class="con3-h2">7. Secure Valuables in Your Hotel Safe </h1>
 <p class="con3-p1">Many hotels provide secure safes to keep important items or documents while traveling. Most hostels also feature lockers to store personal items, but you may need to bring your own lock. <br><br>

    Keep valuable and important items in the safe for extra security from theft, especially if you plan to be away from your hotel for a long period of time. <br><br>
    If you're planning an overnight in a hostel for the first time, understand what you need to know about staying in a hostel so that you can be prepared for the experience. </p>
<h1 class="con3-h2">8. Travel in a Group </h1>
<p class="con3-p1">Solo travel can be freeing and exhilarating, but it might be safer to travel with a friend, family member, partner, or group. Safety and security can often be found in unfamiliar places when you are surrounded by familiar people. </p>

<h1 class="con3-h1">Don't Let Fear Stop You from Traveling </h1>
<p class="con3-p1">Keep these tips in mind to stay safe while traveling, but don't let fear stop you from enjoying your trip. Safety risks are less likely for people who are more aware and prepared. </p>
